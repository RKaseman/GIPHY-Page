I'm pleased with how this turned out.

It's not a bug that the word "women" gets prepended to any search 
term entered in the field. It's a joke by me.

I couldn't figure out how to add a <div> around the pairs of ratings 
and image pairs to get them to display inline and nothing I thought 
of to try with css worked.
