This is the homework for ajax calls and starting and stopping gif 
animations. I had to have a little fun with it.

It's not a bug that the word "women" gets prepended to any search 
term entered in the field. It's a joke by me.

I can't make a decision about leaving console.log lines in my code. 
It's satisfying to be able to successfully trace what's happening or 
going wrong, and it feels like as important a part of the process as 
finished code.

For now I'm having fun designing the appearance of projects with 
mostly css.
